# Project-HWN-A-Live, what's that about?
This project focus is on translating SB69 Fes A Live! (Ver. 1.28.0)\
and it's current goals are: (Sorted by priority)
- Translating Menu's,
- Translating Characters,
- Translating Band stories,
- Making song editor,
- Making custom songs a reality.
- Editing player data (offline),
- Supporting newer versions of the game.\

All of this `Mostlikely will require:`
- [rooted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android)) device.
I won't go into detail on how to root your device since there are *many many* devices,
only tip that i'll give you is to **backup your device** on cloud, pc whatever... Just do it.
------------------
As for bluestack users you will require [rooted bluestacks](https://bstweaker.tk/)
- Download [this software](https://bstweaker.tk/)
- Force kill BlueStacks from Main tab,
- Go to Root tab in BS Tweaker and click on Unlock
- Go to Main tab, open BlueStacks clicking Start BS & let it load completely.
- Go to Root tab and click on Patch and your BlueStacks is rooted.
- To install SuperSu 2.79 click on Install SuperSU
- And thats it, now you have Bluestacks with access to root folder
------------------
So, how would i go about decompiling the game itself?\
- Get your hands on apk file, using [apk extractor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ext.ui) or just download it off internet, doesn't really matter.
- Go to [javadecompilers](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk), click on "Choose file" and then click "Upload and decompile". Keep in mind that his process will take some time.
- use [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) to decompile files you downloaded.
- That's it, that simple.
