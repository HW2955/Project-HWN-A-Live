- Translating Menu's,
- Translating Characters,
- Translating Band stories,
- Making song editor,
- Making custom songs a reality.
- Editing player data (offline),
- Supporting newer versions of the game.\
All of this `Mostlikely will require:`
- [rooted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android)) device.
I won't go into detail on how to root your device since there are *many many* devices,
only tip that i'll give you is to **backup your device** on cloud, pc whatever... Just do it.

As for bluestack users you will require [rooted bluestacks](https://bstweaker.tk/)
- Download [this software](https://bstweaker.tk/)
- Force kill BlueStacks from Main tab,
- Go to Root tab in BS Tweaker and click on Unlock
- Go to Main tab, open BlueStacks clicking Start BS & let it load completely.
- Go to Root tab and click on Patch and your BlueStacks is rooted.
- To install SuperSu 2.79 click on Install SuperSU
